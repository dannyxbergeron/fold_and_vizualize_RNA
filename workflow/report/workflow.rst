A general workflow to retrieve fasta sequences from gene_id or coordinates, and then performed a folding of the sequence with LinearFold (```https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearFold```). A dot bracket file is generated and the molecular free energy for the sequence is extracted. The folded sequence is then plotted using forgi (```https://github.com/ViennaRNA/forgi```) to generated a svg.
